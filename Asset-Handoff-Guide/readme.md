This was created to make the process of handing off the design to developer painless.

# Website Assets Handoff
- Meta Info
- OG image
- Favicon
- Logos need to be SVG or double the size it’s design to be.
- Must be in grid (We use Foundation)
- Must have interaction/hover examples.
- Consistent colors between fonts and backgrounds.
- Don’t use opacity to change colors. (I.E having a white font with opacity on it to darken it.)
- Web fonts have been purchased and we have access to webkit font.
- Try not to have more then 2-3 fonts styles.
- Forms must have error and success messages.
- All links & copy should be provided.
- Have image assets compressed.
- Try to have copy to be (FULLY APPROVED) this prevents copy changes issues and reiterate copy if copy isn't fully approved make a note of it.
- Desktop and Mobile designs have to be provided. (If no mobile design any features that are not on desktop need to be noted.)
