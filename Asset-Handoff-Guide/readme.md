This was created to make the process of handing off the design to developer painless.

# Assets Handoff
- Browsers that are supported
- Account credentials (Hosting,fonts, mailchimp ect)
- Documentation on all features
- GDPR setup (if applies)
- Meta Info
- OG image
- Favicon
- Privacy
- 404 Page Design
- Logos need to be SVG or double the size it’s designed to be.
- Must be in grid (We use Foundation)
- Must have interaction/hover examples of every element that has it.
- Consistent colors between fonts and backgrounds.
- I got this for that - Designer should comb through their design file to make sure all assets are available and icons need to be SVG or must be twice the size for retina.
- Don’t use opacity to change colors. (I.E having a photo with opacity on it to darken it.) Fonts are the expection.
- Web fonts have been purchased and we have access to the webkit fonts.
- Forms must have error and success messages.
- All links & copy should be provided.
- Have image assets compressed.
- Try to have copy to be (FULLY APPROVED) this prevents copy changes issues and reiterate copy and a whole other list of problems. if copy isn't fully approved make a note of it
- Desktop and Mobile designs have to be provided. (If there are no mobile designs. Any features that are not on desktop need to be noted.)
