### This was created to make the process of handing off the design to the development team painless.

# Design Handoff  ðŸš¦
- Desktop and Mobile designs (If there are no mobile designs, any differences between Mobile and Desktop need to be included in the Production notes) 
- Production notes from designer 
- Style guide 
  - Fonts
  - Colors
- Since they tend to be forgotten 
  - 404 page design 
  - Login page design 

#### *Image Requirements* 
- Logos need to be SVG or double the size they are designed to be
- All image / icon assets need to be available to the developer
- Raster image assets should be compressed and 2x for retina

#### *Design Requirements* 
- Must be in grid (We use Foundation) 
- Must have interaction/hover examples for all applicable elements
- Consistent colors between fonts and backgrounds
- Donâ€™t use opacity to change colors (I.E having a photo with opacity on it to darken it.) Fonts are the exception
- Forms must have error and success messages

#### *Design Nice-to-haves* 

- Copy (FULLY APPROVED), this prevents copy changes possibly breaking layout and a whole list of other problems. If copy isn't fully approved make a note of it
