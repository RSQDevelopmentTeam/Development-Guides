#### GIF SUPPORT
- First, not every email client supports animated GIFs. Outlook 2007, 2010 and 2013 won‚Äôt show the animation. Instead, they will show the first frame. To overcome this, many email designers ensure that vital information‚Äîperhaps a call-to-action, offer, or headline‚Äîis included in the first frame of the GIF.

### TEMPLATE WIDTH üìê
- Template width should not exceed `650px` and should preferably be `600px`, but you can make it `800px` (not recommended).


### USE WEB SAFE FONTS
- Currently, the support for web fonts is so limited you should treat them as a fallback if things go well. Check out this  [Article](http://www.adestra.com/what-need-know-using-fonts-in-email/) on using safe fonts.

**Current Email Clients With Web Font Support:**
- AOL Mail
- Native Android mail app (not Gmail app)
- Apple Mail
- iOS Mail
- Outlook 2000
- Outlook.com app

### USE TABLE-BASED LAYOUTS üì∞
- In September 2015, Microsoft launched the latest version of their Outlook client‚ÄîOutlook 2016. Unfortunately, it hasn‚Äôt changed much from its predecessors. Like Outlook 2007, 2010, and 2013, Outlook 2016 renders emails using Microsoft Word, which has poor support for HTML and CSS and has a ton of frustrating quirks.

   More recent versions of Outlook (2007-2016) have poor support for HTML and CSS and include a number of quirks to keep in mind:

  - No support for background images in divs and table cells
  - No support for CSS float or position
  - No support for text shadow
  - Poor support for padding and margin
  - Poor support for CSS width and height
  - Problems with nested elements background colors
  - Due to its lack of support for many CSS properties, table-based layouts are a necessity for optimization in Outlook 2016

### BACKGROUND IMG WITH TEXT ‚ò¢Ô∏è
- Background image sections with `live (aka dynamic text)` on top of them should be limited and not used at all, if possible. You can try using an image with text, but this also isn't recommended. Having said that, you could use a background image with live text, but it leaves you at the mercy of [VML](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/emailology_vector_markup_language_and_backgrounds) which isn't very stable nor is it fully functional.

### BUTTONS üëâüì±
- Display a noticeable call to action that is at `least 40 by 40 pixels` (preferably wider) to allow the reader to easily engage with your email. Also, avoid using hyperlinks and especially avoid cluttering several hyperlinks together. Taping on them could be quite a challenge on mobile. Instead, replace any hyperlinks with buttons.

### ROUNDED BUTTONS
- Although support for `border-radius` is supported mostly every where. It should be noted that Outlook 2016 Windows doesn't support `border-radius` and there for rounded edges are harder to implement in designs that require Outlook 2016 Windows email client.

### IMAGE SIZE üóª
- Given `55%` of emails are opened on mobile devices, and mobile devices load web content more slowly than PCs, you have to be careful how massive your emails are. The images are the heaviest objects in your email, and if you don‚Äôt want to be losing readers due to poor loading time, you will have to use smaller, responsive images. This will save your readers some bandwidth too.

### MAKE IMAGES RETINA READY üåã
- Many devices now include `‚Äúretina‚Äù` displays. This means that they have more physical pixels than their CSS dimensions would otherwise indicate. A 10px wide image might use 20 or more physical pixels to display it. By using extra large images, we can make sure that they appear extra crisp on these displays. Roughly speaking, high-DPI display has twice as many pixels per inch than their traditional counterparts.

### LAWS ‚ö†Ô∏è
- You must have a `unsubscribe button` & `your address` included in the email. This isn't just convention it‚Äôs the law (the CAN-SPAM law).
